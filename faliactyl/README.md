**Setting up Domain**
Point the domain that you are using to your server IP address using an A record.
Installing Nginx and Certbot
```
sudo apt install nginx
sudo apt install certbot
sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx
```
Installing SSL certificate
```
systemctl start nginx
certbot certonly --nginx -d <FALIACTYL_DOMAIN>
```
Make sure to replace ``<FALIACTYL_DOMAIN>`` with your domain name. If you have done this correctly you should see something similar to the following:
```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.faliactyl.domain/fullchain.pem
  Your key file has been saved at:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.faliactyl.domain/privkey.pem
  Your cert will expire on date. To obtain a new or tweaked
  version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
  again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
  "certbot renew"
- If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

  Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
  Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```
If what you saw isn't similar to what you saw in your server, we recommend you ask for support on Faliactyl Discord Server: https://discord.gg/TYCRTGMmHK

Next, if everything's going correctly, you need to go to the Nginx sites directory and create a configuration file:
```
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/faliactyl.conf
```
Now paste the following into the file. Make sure to replace ``<DOMAIN>`` and ``<PORT>`` with your Faliactyl domain and the port Faliactyl is running on.
```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name <DOMAIN>;
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
                      
  server_name <DOMAIN>;
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<DOMAIN>/privkey.pem;
  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
  ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
                      
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:<PORT>/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  }
}
```
Once you have edited, saved, and symlinked your configuration file, restart Nginx with:
```
systemctl restart nginx
```
You should see it running on that domain with SSL!
**Starting Faliactyl**
First we need to install pm2
```
npm install pm2 -g
```
Now you need to go to the Faliactyl directory and use:
```
pm2 start index.js
```
Once you have started Faliactyl, head to the Dashbard URL and Faliactyl should be live!

If there is any Nginx error page such as 502 Bad Gateaway, it means Faliactyl is down.

You can check logs using:
```
pm2 logs
```
If you need help installing, we recommend you ask for support on Faliactyl Discord Server: https://discord.gg/TYCRTGMmHK
